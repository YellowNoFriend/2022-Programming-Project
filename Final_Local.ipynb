    "Recursion is one of the most powerful tools in programming. It is not only a rather intuitive mathematical concept, but it is also easy to implement in any programming language. \n",

    "In this Python project, we will both visually and mathematically appreciate the power of recursion.  We will focus on a set of modules collectively known as `PyGame` [(Shinners, 2021)](#PyGame_Intro). They provide a concise way for us to produce interactive animations within Python.\n",
    "\n",
    "The language of recursion naturally leads to the study of fractals, that is, self-repeating patterns and geometric objects. As we will see later, a lot of patterns in nature are also closely related to fractals.\n"

    "\n",
    "Firstly, in section 1, we introduce and develop a simple pygame animation function `bouncing_ball`, which is one or more balls bouncing in a square box in two dimensions with various constraints.\n",
    "\n",
    "In section 2, we will introduce fractals through the Sierpinski triangle and make an animation of how the Sierpinski triangles are produced.\n",

    "In section 4, we shall look at Julia sequences and we shall animate the Julia set as a transition from one picture to another. In addition to this, we shall look at Mandelbrot sequences, and hence create a program that zooms in and out of the Mandelbrot set.\n",
    "\n",
    "Finally, in section 5, we explore a classical puzzle - the Tower of Hanoi. We will briefly look at the solution, the animation, and other time and space complexity issues.\n"
